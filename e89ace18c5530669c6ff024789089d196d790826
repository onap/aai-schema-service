      "message": "Hi Harish,\n Thank you for your interpretation. These words have specific meanings in communication system, not just abbreviation, they come together to represent an item or make sense. This is appilied or meaningful for all the systems who doing slicing service, not only ONAP. cS should be CS actually, but following the camelCase I think the first letter should also be lower case. Anyway, if following the convention, it is OK to change \n dLThptPerUE uLThptPerSlice cSAvailabilityTarget and cSReliabilityMeanTime into\n dlThptPerUE ulThptPerSlice csAvailabilityTarget and csReliabilityMeanTime, but maxNumberOfPDUSession should remain the same at least.",
